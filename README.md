# Menu
This project will get you used to working with Python classes. You'll write a program that lets a user order things off of a menu; the main "objects" you're working with, menus and orders, will be represented by the Python classes Menu and Order.

This project has three parts, each one building off the previous parts:

    The Menu class and its helper class, MenuItem.
    The Order class and its helper class, OrderItem.
    A program that ties it all together.

You can (and should!) work on this program in stages. A soon as you're done with your menu code, you can make sure it works on Gradescope by uploading menu.py. You can verify your order code early by uploading both menu.py and order.py. Finally, to test your entire program, upload all three files to Gradescope.
